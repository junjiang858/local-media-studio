## Baseline Principle

MVP means fewer product features, not weaker engineering foundations. A Product MVP should have enough structure to extend safely without replacing the core stack.

An engineering baseline is necessary but not sufficient for implementation. Before creating runnable project files, also require the relevant frontend plan, database design, backend spec, AI workflow, tool policy, deployment plan, and Agent rules for the product shape.

## Required Scripts

For JavaScript/TypeScript projects, prefer these root scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | start local development |
| `build` | produce production build |
| `typecheck` | verify TypeScript types |
| `lint` | run ESLint |
| `format` or `format:check` | run or check Prettier formatting |
| `test` | run unit or integration tests |
| `check` | minimal local quality gate, usually typecheck + lint + test + build |
| `clean` | remove generated build artifacts when useful |

## Code Quality

Prefer:

- `.editorconfig`
- ESLint flat config or framework-approved ESLint setup
- Prettier config
- TypeScript strictness appropriate to the framework
- Shared config package when multiple apps/packages need the same rules

Husky, lint-staged, and commitlint are recommended for teams and public projects, but CI remains the required source of enforcement.

## CI

For public or collaborative repositories, add CI early:

1. Install with the committed lockfile.
2. Run `typecheck`.
3. Run `lint`.
4. Run `test`.
5. Run `build`.

CI can skip expensive browser checks until the first UI workflow exists, but it should not skip install, typecheck, lint, tests, and build once those scripts are defined.

## Database Migrations

If the project has a database, define before backend implementation:

- migration tool and config file
- migration directory
- local development database command
- schema generation or introspection command
- rollback or recovery note

Do not treat an example SQL file as the full migration strategy for a product MVP.

## Environment Configuration

Provide `.env.example` with names only, not secrets. Document required variables in `docs/ops/DEPLOYMENT.md` or `docs/architecture/ENGINEERING_BASELINE.md`.

Validate env at runtime for backend services and production builds. Fail fast when required variables are missing.

## Backend Baseline

For an API service, define:

- unified error handler
- request id or correlation id
- structured logging boundary
- validation layer, usually schema or DTO validation
- auth and permission entry point
- path traversal and file upload safety if files are involved
- health check

## Testing Layers

Use the smallest meaningful test layer for each risk:

- Unit tests for pure logic, validation, utility functions, and services.
- Integration tests for API routes, database access, auth boundaries, and migrations.
- Browser or e2e tests for critical user flows after the UI exists.
- Security regression tests for forbidden paths, access control, unsafe uploads, or sensitive data exposure.

## Commit Discipline

Recommended public-project baseline:

- Commit stable stage boundaries.
- Inspect `git status` and `git diff` before commits.
- Keep generated secrets, private config, local databases, and personal notes out of Git.
- Use conventional commit messages or document the project commit style.
