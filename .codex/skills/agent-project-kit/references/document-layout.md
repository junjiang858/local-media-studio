# Document Layout

Use this reference whenever the skill creates, reorganizes, or indexes project source-of-truth documents.

## Default Layout

Keep the repository root scannable. `AGENTS.md` stays at the root because agents naturally look there first. Detailed project documents live under `docs/`.

```text
.
├── AGENTS.md
├── README.md
├── apps/
├── packages/
└── docs/
    ├── project/
    │   └── PROJECT_CHARTER.md
    ├── architecture/
    │   ├── TECH_STACK.md
    │   ├── ENGINEERING_BASELINE.md
    │   ├── FRONTEND_PLAN.md
    │   ├── DATABASE_DESIGN.md
    │   └── BACKEND_SPEC.md
    ├── workflow/
    │   └── AI_WORKFLOW.md
    └── ops/
        ├── TOOL_POLICY.md
        └── DEPLOYMENT.md
```

## Root Rules

Root may contain entry points and tooling only: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, package manager files, lockfiles, repo config, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `apps/`, `packages/`, `docs/`, `.codex/`, and `.github/`.

Do not put detailed planning documents in the root unless the user explicitly requests a flat layout.

## AGENTS.md Role

Use root `AGENTS.md` as a short index and operating contract:

- Link to the project source-of-truth documents under `docs/`.
- State source-of-truth priority and completion definition.
- Keep stable rules only.
- Do not duplicate the full contents of `docs/architecture/TECH_STACK.md`, `docs/ops/TOOL_POLICY.md`, or specs.

## Path Mapping

| Artifact             | Default path                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Agent constitution   | `AGENTS.md`                                 |
| Project charter      | `docs/project/PROJECT_CHARTER.md`           |
| Tech stack           | `docs/architecture/TECH_STACK.md`           |
| Engineering baseline | `docs/architecture/ENGINEERING_BASELINE.md` |
| Frontend plan        | `docs/architecture/FRONTEND_PLAN.md`        |
| Database design      | `docs/architecture/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`      |
| Backend spec         | `docs/architecture/BACKEND_SPEC.md`         |
| AI workflow          | `docs/workflow/AI_WORKFLOW.md`              |
| Tool policy          | `docs/ops/TOOL_POLICY.md`                   |
| Deployment plan      | `docs/ops/DEPLOYMENT.md`                    |

## Migration Rule

If old root documents already exist, do not move them silently. Propose a migration plan, list old and new paths, and ask for confirmation before moving files.
