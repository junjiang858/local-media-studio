# AI_WORKFLOW

## Flow

1. Clarify the request.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` and relevant project documents under `docs/`.
3. Produce or update a plan.
4. If the task changes design, frontend source tree, component boundaries, contracts, data shape, permissions, tools, deployment, or operations, update the affected source-of-truth document first.
5. Implement the smallest useful change against the updated documents.
6. Run checks.
7. Report changed-doc summary and evidence.

## Human Confirmation Required

- Scope changes.
- New major dependency.
- Production or external account actions.
- Destructive operations.
- Security-sensitive changes.
- Source-of-truth document changes when the project requires document consent.

## Evidence by Work Type

| Work type | Evidence                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Docs      | changed files and decision summary          |
| Frontend  | build/check output and browser verification |
| Backend   | tests, health check, API sample             |
| Database  | schema/migration diff and rollback note     |
| Security  | risk table, code locations, verification    |

When implementation changes design or contracts, docs evidence must come before code evidence.
When frontend implementation changes source tree, file responsibilities, component boundaries, state/config/i18n/utils ownership, or import boundaries, `docs/architecture/FRONTEND_PLAN.md` evidence must come before code evidence.
